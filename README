REQUIREMENTS
----------------

1. MySQL version >= 5.x 

2. Web server running PHP version >= 5.2 with MySQL support.  If LDAP
   is desired, PHP must also have LDAP support.

3. YUI >= 2.7 (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui) (included)
   
4. Due to the filesystem differences, currently only UNIX/Linux systems are 
   supported on the server side.
   
5. Your PHP ini file should set reasonable values for post_max_size and 
   upload_max_filesize, as these obviously affect file uploads.  (Also, check
   the value for memory_limit.)
   
6. The zip executable (http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html) must be installed on 
   the server in order to support downloads of multiple files.
