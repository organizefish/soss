SOSS: Simple Online Submission System
==========================================

This is a simple system for managing uploaded files, primarily for use within
a classroom setting.  It allows you to manage a set of classes, populate the
classes with students, and create a set of assignments for each class.  Students
can upload one or more files for each assignment, and the instructor can
view and download the submitted files individually or in bulk.

This system is designed with the needs of computer science classes in mind, but
could be used with other classes as well.  It is designed to be very lightweight,
with very few requirements.  It provides a smaller alternative to more bulky
solutions like Moodle, Sakai, or Blackboard.

REQUIREMENTS
================

1. MySQL version >= 5.x 

2. Web server running PHP version >= 5.2 with MySQL support.  If LDAP
   is desired, PHP must also have LDAP support.

3. YUI >= 2.7 (http://developer.yahoo.com/yui) (included)
   
4. Due to the filesystem differences, currently only UNIX/Linux systems are 
   supported on the server side.
   
5. Your PHP ini file should set reasonable values for post_max_size and 
   upload_max_filesize, as these obviously affect file uploads.  (Also, check
   the value for memory_limit.)
   
6. The zip executable (http://www.info-zip.org/Zip.html) must be installed on 
   the server in order to support downloads of multiple files.
