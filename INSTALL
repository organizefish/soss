 INSTALLATION
----------------

0. Make sure that your
   PHP installation includes Zip support and LDAP (if LDAP is desired).

1. Create a MySQL user and database for the SOSS system.  For the purposes
   of this document, I will assume that the database is called soss_db and
   the user with full privileges to this database is soss_user.
   
   $ mysqladmin --user=root -p create soss_db
   $ mysql --user=root -p mysql
   mysql> CREATE USER soss_user;
   mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON soss_db.* TO 'soss_user'@'localhost' 
       -> IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';

2. Unpack the SOSS tarball into a directory that is accessible by the web
   server.
   
3. Create the database tables using the create_tables.sql script located in
   the db directory.  For example:
   
   $ mysql -u soss_user -p soss_db < db/phpsoss_db.sql

4. Create a directory for the storage of uploaded files.  This directory
   need not be in the web tree, but must have write and execute permissions 
   for the user that the web server runs under.
   
5. Edit the file config.php to match your installation.  Take special care to
   change the SOSS_FILE_REPOSITORY constant to point to the directory that
   you created in the previous step.
   
6. (Optional) Edit the files student.html, admin.html, and grader.html
   to make them more appropriate for your users.  Search for "PAGE TITLE",
   "PAGE FOOTER", and "PASSWORD WARNING".
   
7. Bring up the file faculty_login.html through your web server, the default
   password is "faculty" (you should probably change it).
